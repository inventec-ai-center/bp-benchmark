# The expected files are the following: 
# "bcg_pat_info.csv" file with the demographic information of the subjects.
# "pats" directory with one CSV file named "pat<id_subject>pred.csv" per patient with vital signals.
# These files have to be generated using MatLab from the original data (run BCG-mat2csv.mat file).

# Window size to segment the signal. 
# Set either win_sec in seconds or win_sam in samples 
win_sec: 5 #Window size in seconds
win_sam: null #Window size in samples

#Waiting window for next segment in seconds
win_wait: 0 

#Original frequency sampling rate
fs: 1000

#Resampling frequency rate (-1 to keep the original fs)
resampling: 125
